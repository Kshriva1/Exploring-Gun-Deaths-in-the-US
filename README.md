# Exploring-Gun-Deaths-in-the-US

In this project, we will be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on gun deaths in the US.

The dataset came from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data). The dataset is stored in the ```guns.csv``` file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim.
